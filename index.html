          <h2>Portfolio Concept</h2>
          <p>My portfolio concept is to create a site showcasing my work with designing sites and photography. I have ideas regarding applications that will be further developed into a startup business and then later link them to my portfolio. The photography aspect will showcase some of my more artistic work.</p>
