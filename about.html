					<h3>Terry's story</h3>
					<p>
						Terry Lowery is a systems engineer for Rackspace, the #1 managed cloud company, headquartered in San Antonio, TX. Terry has worked in the computer field since 1999. During that time, he migrated an accounting and point of sale system from a small NT 4.0 domain to Windows 2000 Active directory. This gave him an opportunity to learn general principals in accounting, point of sale systems, and later trained staff on how to use them. After discovering his passion for computer systems, he was given the chance to work with school systems, colleges, state governments, and consulting companies. 
						In 2010, Terry decided to leave the four-seasoned state of Pennsylvania to move to big beautiful Texas to begin his career with Rackspace. 
					</p>
					<p>
						During Terry's downtime, he enjoys the outdoors, flying light airplanes, writing code, and taking pictures. Family is always included in most of Terry's outdoor adventures. Terry is a father of two beautiful kids and engaged to a wonderful Texas lady.</p>
